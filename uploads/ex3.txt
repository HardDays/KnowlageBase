1)
-If x = 0, then we have a deadlock (clear). 
-If x = 1, then it's obviousM that process D can run to completion. 
When it's finished, vector would be {1, 1, 2, 2, 1}. 
-We see, that now A can run to complete, vector would be {2, 1, 4, 3, 2}. 
-Then C can run successfully, it would return vector {3, 2, 4, 4, 2}. 
-Then B can be runned. 
Sequence is: D A C B.

Deadlock is impossible in this system. 
We can say, that each process has only one resource. There is one resource that is free. 
As we can see, deadlock is impossible.
