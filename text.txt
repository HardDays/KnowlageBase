Measurement of ultra low outgassing rates for NLC UHV vacuum chambers 
Ultra low outgassing rates would be highly advantageous in accelerators and storage rings, such as the Next Linear Collider (NLC), where an outgassing rate of &lt;10<sup>-12</sup> Torr liter/sec/cm<sup>2 </sup> could eliminate the need for costly distributed pumping. Measuring such low outgassing rates at room temperature has many difficulties. However, by inspection of Fick's law, it can be seen that thermal desorption is proportional to outgassing rate. It is commonly observed that the outgas rate doubles approximately every 15&deg;C for temperatures under 100&deg;C. By measuring outgassing rate versus temperature and time and extrapolating back to room temperature we can measure outgassing rates that would otherwise be difficult to make. To produce a reliable measurement also requires the total surface area under study to be approximately an order of magnitude greater than the area of the measurement chamber walls. To accomplish this, 27 plates of 5083 aluminum were placed in the measurement chamber. This technique will be the basis for future investigation of outgassing rates of other sample plates fabricated with different machining and cleaning techniques 

Performance of Energy Efficient Source Coding and Interference Reduction in Wireless Sensor Network Systems 
In this paper, our focus is on energy efficient coding schemes for wireless sensor networks. A source coding and modulation technique for reducing multiple access interference (MAI) as well as for reducing power consumption in MC-CDMA wireless sensor network systems is presented. In all our analysis we consider perfect power control mechanism. Source symbols are represented by a special coding, termed Minimum Energy coding (ME coding), which exploits redundant bits for saving power when transmitted via RF links with On-Off-Keying. This ME coding is applied to MC-CDMA sensor network systems in order to reduce MAI as well as to reduce power consumption. The proposed method is aptly suitable for wireless sensor video node in application of video coding. 

Spallation Neutron Source linac vacuum seal design and testing 
Optimum seal selection with respect to vacuum performance, RF electrical performance, life, cost, reliability, and case of installation is of primary importance. This report summarizes an investigation of metallic vacuum seals including the C-seal, energized spring seal, Helicoflex copper delta seal, aluminum delta seal, delta seal with limiting ring, and a prototype copper diamond seal. This study was conducted to support the drift tube linac (DTL) and coupled cavity linac (CCL) design efforts for the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) project. A series of vacuum leak rate tests using necessary reduced thickness flange designs has been completed. Copper plated stainless steel flanges, necessary for flanged joints intersecting RF cavities, have also been studied and tested. Detailed structural modeling of the CCL bridge coupler seal and flange has also been completed to verify flange structural integrity and appropriate seal compressive loading 

Performance Comparison of On-Demand and Table Driven Ad Hoc Routing Protocols Using NCTUns 
The main aim of any ad-hoc network routing protocol is to meet the challenges of the dynamically changing topology and establish a correct and an efficient communication path between any two nodes with minimum routing overhead and bandwidth consumption. The design problem of such a routing protocol is not simple since an ad hoc environment introduces new challenges that are not present in fixed networks. A number of routing protocols have been proposed for this purpose like Ad Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), Destination- Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV). In this paper, we study and compare the performance of the following three routing protocols AODV, DSR and DSDV. NCTUns 4.0 is used to study the relative performance of the routing protocols according to different criteria. The notable point of our analysis is that, it is based on varying number of nodes in the ad hoc network. 

Trends in knowledge base processing using optical techniques 
A review is presented of recent research efforts, along with a discussion of the relative merits and limitations of using optics as an implementation technology. To a large extent, past efforts have focused on representing knowledge using matrix-like formalisms and designing system architectures based on optical inner-product processors (such as matrix-vector multipliers) and optical correlators. Actual implementations are impeded primarily by the limitations of current spatial light modulators. New directions include the use of symbolic substitution and neural network ideas

QR Codes as a time management tool in m-learning 
The constant development and increased usage of ICT, especially mobile communications and Web technologies, has enabled users to use specific ICT solutions such as automatic identification and data capture techniques using QR Codes in order to improve learning processes. This paper researches the benefits of using QR Codes in m-learning, and presents examples of how QR Codes can be used to enhance learning processes. Universities and other educational institutions should implement m-learning to provide their students with &#x201C;just in time&#x201D; information and learning materials, in order to facilitate distance learning. This can be improved by using QR Codes with the purpose of better time management for both parties: students and professors. 

Mechanical design of the SNS coupled cavity accelerator 
The mechanical design and manufacturing details of the Spallation Neutron Source Coupled Cavity Linac are presented. The mechanical design and manufacturing approach for the RF cavity components is and results of initial development work for manufacturing is presented. The RF cavity components include both the main accelerating cavity structure (RF Segments) and the bridge couplers. The design utilizes a relatively standard approach for the RF accelerating segments but novel packaging techniques for the bridge coupler allow a minimum length coupler to be used. The resulting structure allows for a short magnetic focusing period and straightforward tuning of the multi-segment module 

An Agent-Based Simulation of SOA-Ready Devices 
In the future Internet of Things, intelligent embedded devices are expected to not only offer their functionality as a web service, but also to be able to discover and cooperate with other devices and services in a peer-to-peer way. The new capabilities of the emerging infrastructure will have a significant impact on industrial applications, services and business practices. In this paper we explore the simulation of such an infrastructure composed of heterogeneous web-service enabled (SOA-ready) devices with the help of a multi-agent system. 

An optimal power delivery problem in deregulated open access environments 
In this paper, we formulate an optimal power delivery (OPD) problem, in terms of transmitted line flows, for the future deregulated/restructured open access environments. It includes some FACTS (flexible AC transmission systems) devices, such as phase shifters and series compensators. The transmission losses are considered and are represented by the transmitted line flows across those lines. The problem can be solved by our fast textured decomposition algorithm. Moreover, the formulation takes care of the loop flow problem by minimizing the total transmission loss. Examples are used to demonstrate this point. We also show that the FACTS devices can be used to reduce the total transmission loss 

Optimal precoder design for mimo systems using decision feedback receivers 
For precoder design problems in a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication system, perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) at both the transmitter and the receiver is usually required. However, it is often difficult to provide sufficiently timely and accurate feedback of CSI from the receiver to the transmitter for such designs to be practically viable. In this paper, we consider the optimum design of a precoder for a wireless communication link having M transmitter antennas and N receiver antennas (M &lt; N), in which the channels are assumed to be flat fading and may be correlated. We assume that full CSI is known at the receiver, but only the first- and second-order statistics of the channels are available at the transmitter. Our goal is to come up with an efficient design of the optimal precoder for such a MIMO system by minimizing the average arithmetic mean-squared error (MSE) of zero-forcing decision feedback (ZF-DF) detection subject to a constraint on the total transmitting power. We transform this non-convex optimization problem into a convex geometrical programming problem, which can then be efficiently solved using an interior point method. For the case when the transmission channels are uncorrelated, a closed-form solution of the optimum precoder has been obtained. The superior performance of our MIMO system equipped with the optimum precoder is verified by computer simulations. 

Learning effects in telemanipulation with monoscopic versus stereoscopic remote viewing 
An investigation has been carried out on the effects of skill acquisition of the type of closed circuit video system being used in a teleoperation system. Two experiments were performed, using a mobile explosive ordnance disposal robot equipped with a switchable monoscopic/stereoscopic video system. One experiment comprised a simple, repetitive approach-and-touch task. The other involved a Fitts' law type of speed/accuracy tradeoff task. In both experiments, subjects' learning data were recorded. The results are discussed in terms of relative performance of stereoscopic versus monoscopic viewing, as a function of repetition number and of task difficulty. An important result is that for highly repetitive tasks it is less demanding to perform the task using a stereoscopic display than using a monoscopic display at all levels of experience 

Development of mm-wave solid state devices in China (invited)

Investment analysis of Information Security Management in Croatian seaports 
Existing models of Information Security Management Systems in seaports usually involve threat evaluation, vulnerability management and risk analysis. Threat evaluation is a catalogue based analysis, outlining various applicable protection levels related to architecture, hardware, software and personnel, aiming to standardize the information security management approach. Vulnerability analysis is attempting to evaluate organizational and technical aspects of all information security components in terms of their inherent flaws. Risk analysis combines both threat and vulnerability analysis in order to define countermeasures in an objective, measurable and sustainable way. However, very often all three possible approaches are devoid of economic and financial analysis of seaport information security investments. In this paper authors propose a combined model which includes both technical and financial approach to information security management and decision-making in Croatian Port Community Systems. 

Harmonics mitigation and stability analysis of DTC motor drives in MVDC systems 
This paper analyzes the harmonics emission, propagation, and mitigation issues in an MVDC distribution system. Specifically, the DC current harmonics from a high power NPC DTC motor drive is analyzed. It is found that DC network resonance is a major cause of DC current harmonics amplification and propagation in the MVDC system. As a result, adding a DC-side input filter inductor is proposed to attenuate current harmonics from NPC DTC drives. A dc-side filter design method based on system impedance models, with consideration on stability and DC network resonance, is presented and verified by simulations. 

Study on Wellsite Toxic Gas Leakage and Dispersion of High Temperature High Pressure Gas Wells with High Sulfur Content 
During the drilling, completion and testing of gas well with high temperature, high pressure and high sulfur content, toxic gas leakage is dangerous and may bring severe consequences. It's important for the safety of personnel and assets to ascertain the leaking position and research the leakage characteristics. Focusing on the wellsite-scale space, this paper discussed the key position of leakage for different well procedures, and calculated the dispersion of leaked gas with the software FLUENT based on three dimension methods of computational fluid dynamics. Characteristics of toxic gas dispersion is discussed, and influence of wind speed, toxic gas components, leakage flowrate, temperature and wellsite obstacles is considered, which would help to optimize the monitoring locations. New proposal was put forward in simulation of multi-component gas disperion on wellsite, as well as in explaination of toxic gas accumulation around obstacles. 

Development of the movable mask free from trapped mode for the KEKB 
The movable mask is a device that cuts off spent electrons/positrons near the beam orbit and reduces background of the detector. For the KEKB, sixteen movable masks had been installed for each ring. The originally designed masks, however, had severe troubles of heating, arcing and vacuum leaks. Several kinds of improved masks had been designed partially employing RF technologies in dealing with HOM and were installed to the ring step by step. The latest masks are working almost as expected now. Here the problems of movable masks so far are summarized and the structure of the latest movable masks and their status are presented

Modeling of electron cyclotron resonance ion source plasmas 
A computer model for both electrons and multiple ion species in an Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source (ECRIS) plasma that is ID spatially has been developed. The non-Maxwellian anisotropic electron-distribution-function (EDF) is modeled using a ID axially bounce-averaged Fokker-Planck code that is 2D in velocity space (velocity and pitch angle). ECR heating is treated using a quasi-linear rf-diffusion term including relativistic detuning and rf pitch-angle scattering. Under typical ECRIS conditions, the electrons are very non-collisional and magnetically confined. Thus, the ions must follow the electron confinement via the electrostatic potential. The ion species are assumed to be highly collisionally coupled and are treated using a 1D fluid model characterized by a single fluid velocity. Ion charge-state-distributions (CSD) flowing into the extraction aperture can be calculated and used as input to an ion beam extraction code. The modeling reproduces several experimentally observed characteristics of ECRIS plasmas 

SOM-Based Modelling for an Activated Sludge Treatment Process 
The control of an activated sludge treatment plant depends on on-line process data and measurements made in the laboratory. The most important quality indicators of activated sludge are settling properties. Even though the behaviour of activated sludge is basically known, long lags and the complex characteristic of biological activity set a challenge for controlling the process. In this paper, the process lags of an activated sludge treatment plant are determined by a cross-correlation method. We also demonstrate the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for analysing an activated sludge treatment process. A data set of the process was used for training a SOM, which could be used for estimating the diluted sludge volume index (DSVI). The results of a validation data set showed a good agreement between the actual and estimated values of DSVI. The results indicate that the SOM method can also be efficiently applied to the analysis of the activated sludge treatment process and so towards better process control. 

DOA Estimation of multipath clusters in WiMedia UWB systems 
Ultra wideband (UWB) systems are expected to find widespread use in future short range applications. Increasing popularity of these devices will require management of occupied spectrum in spatial domain to keep the interference low. In UWB systems, one encounters many multipath components. By optimally forming beams in the direction of the principal multipath clusters, one can achieve optimum spectrum efficiency. The number of components would depend on the sampling rate as the number of resolvable components depends on it. Besides, many of the multipath components would be coming from the same cluster. The estimation of the Direction of Arrival (DOA) of these clusters is very useful to focus the transmit power in the optimum direction. A new algorithm, exploiting the known pilot signals of multiband UWB systems for estimation of DOA of clusters in the presence of inband interferers is proposed in this paper. By making use of a new matrix incorporating the cross correlation between the focused UWB signal and the known pilot signal of the transmitted data in each array element, one would be able to separate the multipath clusters from a single source. It is proven that the proposed new matrix would span the same subspace as the direction of arrival vectors and the eigen vectors corresponding to the zero eigen value of the product of this new matrix with its Hermitian would span the orthogonal compliment of the DOA subspace. Computer experiments are included to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm.

Automatic basis selection for RBF networks using Stein's unbiased risk estimator 
The problem of selecting the appropriate number of basis functions is a critical issue for radial basis function neural networks. An RBF network with an overlay restricted basis gives poor predictions on new data, since the model has too little flexibility. By contrast, an RBF network with too many basis functions also gives poor generalization performance since it is too flexible and fits too much of the noise on the training data. Bias and variance are complementary quantities, and it is necessary to assign the number of basis function optimally in order to achieve the best compromise between them. In this paper we derive a theoretical criterion for assigning the appropriate number of basis functions. We use Stein's unbiased risk estimator (SURE) to drive a genetic criterion that defines the optimum number of basis functions to use for a given problem. The efficacy of this criterion is illustrated experimentally. 

Dynamic search under false alarms 
We consider the dynamic search of a target located in one of K cells. At each time, one cell is searched, and the search result is subject to false alarms. The objective is a policy that governs the sequential selection of the cells to minimize the error probability of detecting the whereabouts of the target within a fixed time horizon. We show that the optimal search policy is myopic in nature with a simple structure. The result finds applications in statistical fraud detection, anomaly localization, and target search.

Troubleshooting with an inaccurate mental model 
In some fault-diagnosis situations, troubleshooters may misunderstand system structure and functioning. An experiment examined how a troubleshooter's mental model of a logic network might prejudice the ability to diagnose previously unseen faults. In the knowledge acquisition phase, subjects inferred the structure of a logic network by viewing it in different states. Most subjects ended up with slightly inaccurate mental models of the network. In the fault-diagnosis phase, subjects were required to diagnose novel faults placed in the network. Two factors were varied in a 2&times;2 design: whether a subject believed a link existed or not, and whether the belief was true or false. Faults involved the addition of new links or the deletion of existing links. Subjects had difficulty diagnosing faults that involved links they believed did not exist and faults that influenced parts of the network about which they had false beliefs, and it was harder for subjects to see that something was wrong with the network if the fault involved a network link they believed not to exist. However, the ability to see the symptoms of the fault was not always a guarantee of correct fault diagnosis

This brings some challenges and issues which must be addressed before potential information loss, security vulnerability or unintended sharing. How will next generation of software look like and where is it shifting to? Several answers are emerging, let's take a look.

Tests have shown that liquids like blood are drawn into the needle by capillary forces, reducing the need for active pumping. The fabrication method allows different needle shapes like blades and pencils, is robust enough to be applied for larger scale production, and enables the development of a complete micro-TAS for e.g. blood analysis. 

Failure initiation of IGBT due to emitter contact degradation: A 2D finite elements electro-thermal multi-cell simulation approach under hard switching, short-circuit and avalanche operations 
This paper reports, for the first time, the internal physics of IGBT under severe switching conditions based on 2D finite elements multi-cell device simulation pointing out the advantages of such approach particularly in the case of a packaging degradation due to wire-bonding lift-off or top metallization ageing. The results show that the multi-cell simulation highlights intercellular electro-thermal phenomena which may lead the IGBT into failure. A full internal analysis allows to focus on the main internal physics parameters and to provide useful information on the device failure initiation and interesting issue to increase the device robustness for devices designers. 

Investigation of energy harvesting circuit using a capacitor-sourced buck converter for a tubular linear generator of a moball: A spherical wind-driven exploration robot 
Moball is a spherical wind-driven exploration robot intended for in-situ observation of scientifically important environments, such as Arctic, Mars, and Saturn's moon Titan. Moball has three orthogonal linear generators/actuators to enable both the steering control and energy harvesting. This paper focuses on the energy harvesting circuit for the Moball's linear generator which has non-sinusoidal pulse voltage waveform. Battery charging using a capacitor-sourced buck converter is analytically and numerically investigated. The power transferred to the battery is actively regulated to maintain the stable operation. The simulation results demonstrated that stable constant current charging was achieved.

Trends, implications and overview of complex organizations with a focus on the aerospace industry 
The aerospace industry is at the forefront of technological innovation, both at product level and manufacturing and support levels. We draw upon our experience in this sector to illustrate the increasing challenges that large-scale complex organizations, exemplified by this sector, are facing. We examine why traditional methodologies are no longer globally appropriate and discuss how work on multi agent systems and emergence is promising the means to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches. Furthermore, we draw upon our research on relating organizational structure to performance to illustrate how such potential solutions can be applied to organizational complexity. Finally, we conclude by looking at the future of this industry and the technological solutions that may play a part in its evolution 

Wearable and implantable antennas: Applications in communications, monitoring and diagnostics 
About a quarter of century ago, the research community was advertising the concept of &#x201C;global connectivity with anyone, at any time, in any place and with any amount of data&#x201D;. This is now a reality. The next big paradigm is &#x201C;bio-telemetry connecting patients to their doctors and hospitals at anytime, any location and with any amount of monitoring and diagnostics data&#x201D;. History has shown that it typically takes about a quarter of century to bring any out-to-the-box idea into the mainstream. We are in the midst of this new paradigm to becoming a reality. 

Observation and simulation of the nonlinear dependence of vacuum pressures on the positron beam current at the KEKB 
A non-linear dependence of vacuum pressure on the beam current has been observed in the KEKB positron ring. The behaviour changes with the bunch fill pattern, the bunch current and the external magnetic field, which is similar to that of the beam size blow up phenomenon. A simple simulation on the non-linear pressure rise is proposed assuming that the behaviour occurs by the electron multipactoring. The simulation well reproduces the observed non-linear pressure behaviours. The results support a suggestion that the beam size blow up is caused by the electron cloud around the positron beam 

A Decision Model for Group Assessment of Credit Applications 
This paper proposes a group decision model for the assessment of credit/loan applications by a team. As many new players enter the finance sector, offering new products and different forms of financing, it is important that credit applications are assessed from multiple angles including the marketing and risk management sides. While external organisations offer independent ratings and credit reports of potential applicants, lending firms need to take into account internal criteria in order to effectively allocate and grant credit to their customers. Individual products target specific customer profiles:in this paper we propose a tool to support the multicriteria assessment and classification of the applicants' profile aiming for a good match between the product and the customer. This will look at expanding the firm's customer base with a reduced risk of bad credit. 

Investigation of Substation Installed Shunt Active Power Filter in AC Electrified Railway Systems 
25 Kv Ac electrified railway power systems have the following shortcomings as far as the quality of their power supply is concerned: higher harmonic supply current pollution, feeder supply voltage perturbations and the demand for reactive power. These power quality issues have a detrimental impact on the railway power supply system itself as well as on the other electric power systems integrated with it. This paper investigates the performance of single phase active power filters (SAPFs) which are introduced in order to address these quality issues. These filters can be installed at either the substation end (S/S) or at the sectioning post (SP) of the railway power system. In this investigation novel control algorithms, based on the synchronously rotating frame of reference, are proposed for the case when the SAPF is installed at the substation end and its performance is assessed. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms are illustrated via Matlab/ PowerSim computer simulations and validated via comparisons with other publications. This investigation demonstrated that when the SAPF is installed at the substation side, it can effectively compensate for the higher harmonic supply current. In addition, the reactive power demand is fully compensated for, leading to a unity power factor. However, the voltage drop/sag at the locomotive power entry point is not fully compensated for. 

Loop transfer recovery with minimal-order observers 
A solution to the problem of loop transfer recovery with minimal order observers is obtained for the control loop broken at the plant input. Three distinct cases are treated - depending on the properties of the first Markov parameter of the plant model. For two of these cases a LQG-type design method is outlined. If the first Markov parameter is of full rank exact loop transfer recovery can be achieved. 

Parallel FETI-DP for efficient EM analysis of general objects and antenna arrays 
An efficient parallelization of the dual-primal finite-element tearing and interconnecting algorithm (FETI-DP) is presented for large-scale electromagnetic simulations. To reduce global reductions, iterative solvers with an iterating classical Gram-Schmidt (ICGS) scheme and a communication-avoiding (CA) approach are respectively implemented for the interface problem and the coarse corner problem. Based on the sparse pattern of the coarse system, a sparse preconditioner is developed to improve the convergence rate of the iterative solution. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the scalability and capability of the method for modeling of general objects and antenna arrays.

Combined thermionic and photoelectric emission from dispenser cathodes 
Photoelectric emission from dispenser cathodes has been studied earlier. Photoelectric emission in conjunction with themionic emission can provide a convenient and flexible means of modulating emission from thermionic cathodes with programmable formats and high bandwidth. This may be useful for experimental studies the beam dynamics of space charge dominated beams, such as in the University of Maryland electron ring (UMER). We have studied combined photoelectric and thermionic emission from a dispenser cathode using a nitrogen laser operating at 337 nm. Results will be presented for the effect on emission of laser intensity, cathode temperature, and accelerating voltage 

Fuzzy Online Risk Assessment for Distributed Intrusion Prediction and Prevention Systems 
A Distributed Intrusion Prediction and Prevention Systems (DIPPS) not only detects and prevents possible intrusions but also possesses the capability to predict possible intrusions in a distributed network. Based on the DIPS sensors, instead of merely preventing the attackers or blocking traffic, we propose a fuzzy logic based online risk assessment scheme. The key idea of DIPPS is to protect the network(s) linked to assets, which are considered to be very risky. To implement DIPPS we used a Distributed Intrusion Detection System (DIDS) with extended real time traffic surveillance and online risk assessment. To model and predict the next step of an attacker, we used a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that captures the interaction between the attacker and the network. The interaction between various DIDS and integration of their output are achieved through a HMM. The novelty of this paper is the detailed development of Fuzzy Logic Controllers to estimate the various risk(s) that are dependent on several other variables based on the inputs from HMM modules and the DIDS agents. To develop the fuzzy risk expert system, if-then fuzzy rules were formulated based on interviews with security experts and network administrators. Preliminary results indicate that such a system is very practical for protecting assets which are prone to attacks or misuse, i.e. highly at risk.

DOA estimation method for wideband color signals based on least-squares Joint Approximate Diagonalization 
Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is one of the major task in many acoustic array signal processing applications. In this work, we show that a modified joint approximate diagonlization (MJAD) method utilizing temporal structure of the wideband color signals can outperform the conventional wideband DOA estimation method such as approximate maximum likelihood (AML) and coherent signal-subspace processing(CSSP). 

A Survey of Intelligent Language Tutoring Systems 
Intelligent Languages Tutoring Systems (ILTSs) plays a significant role in evaluating students' answers through interaction with them. ILTSs implements Natural Language processing (NLP) techniques in order to allow free input of words and sentences. ILTSs have the capability of identifying the input errors and provide an immediate feedback along with the errors source. It has been observed that ILTSs were not surveyed intensively; the reason that motivates us to conduct this research. Some NLP recent trends such as Latent Sematic Analysis and entailment were demonstrated. Different ILTSs have been discussed with a dedicated section about the development of Arabic ILTSs. Arabic share many of its characteristics with Semitic and morphologically rich languages. In our presentation we point out new trends that have been emerged while conducting survey.

Numerical solution of elliptic partial differential equation by growing radial basis function neural networks 
In this paper a neural network for solving partial differential equations (PDE) is described. The activation functions of the hidden nodes are the radial basis functions (RBF) whose parameters are learnt by a two-stage gradient descent strategy. A new growing radial basis functions-node insertion strategy with different radial basis functions is used in order to improve the net performances. The learning strategy is able to save computational time and memory space because of the selective growing of nodes whose activation functions consist of different radial basis functions. An analysis of the learning capabilities and a comparison of the net performances with other approaches have been performed. It is shown that the resulting network improves the approximation results. 

Control of sensing by navigation on information gradients 
In estimation of parameters residing in a smooth manifold from sensor data, the Fisher information induces a Riemannian metric on the parameter manifold. If the collection of sensors is reconfigured, this metric changes. In this way, sensor configurations are identified with Riemannian metrics on the parameter manifold. The collection of all Riemannian metrics on a manifold forms a (weak) Riemannian manifold, and a smooth trajectory of sensor configurations manifests as a smooth curve in this space. This paper develops the idea of sensor management by following trajectories in the space of sensor configurations that are defined locally by gradients of the metric this space inherits from the abstract space of all Riemannian metrics on the parameter manifold. Theory is developed and computational examples that illustrate sensor configuration trajectories arising from this scheme are presented.

Dry process technology for high frequency SAW devices 
Dry etching for fine patterns in high-frequency SAW (surface acoustic wave) devices is described. Several dry-etching processes are discussed in the connection with the following subjects: etching anisotropy, selectivity to photoresists and substrates (LiNbO<sub>3</sub>, LiTaO<sub>3</sub>, and quartz), and substrate damage. For the etching of fine Al electrodes in high-frequency SAW devices, reactive ion etching (RIE) is chosen, because RIE is the most cost-effective among the anisotropic dry-etching processes and is adequate for electrodes with low aspect ratios. Problems associated with the RIE were poor reproducibility (for example, induction of Al corrosion) and damage of the substrates. These problems are related to residual Cl from chlorinated etching gases and to Li contained in the substrates, e.g. LiNbO<sub>3</sub> and LiTaO<sub>3</sub>. The defects caused by the corrosion are removed mainly by CF<sub>4</sub> post-sputter treatment just after RIE without exposing the substrates to the air. A damage-free process condition is obtained by measuring SAW velocity dispersion, etch depth, substrate roughness, and RHEED (reflection of high-energy electron diffraction) 

Reducing system overheads in home-based software DSMs 
Software DSM systems suffer from the high communication and coherence-induced overheads that limit performance. This paper introduces our efforts in reducing system overheads of a home-based software DSM called JIAJIA. Three measures, including eliminating false sharing through avoiding unnecessarily invalidating cached pages, reducing virtual memory page faults with a new write detection scheme, and propagating barrier message in a hierarchical way, are taken to reduce the system overhead of JIAJIA. Evaluation with some well-known DSM benchmarks reveals that, though varying with memory reference patterns of different applications, these measures can reduce system overhead of JIAJIA effectively 

Polyimide/Carbon Nanotubes Composite Films: A Potential for FPCB 
Polyimide/carbon nanotube (CNT) composite films for potential use in more efficient flexible copper clad laminated (FCCL) films for flexible printed circuit boards (FPCB) were prepared by mixing a polyisoimide (PII) solution and a CNT suspension in NMP followed by casting, evaporation, and thermal imidization. The CNTs were modified by a nitric acid treatment in order to improve the thermal and electrical properties as well as to provide good dispersion of the CNTs in a polymer matrix. The formation of functional groups on the modified CNT was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the modified CNTs to be well dispersed in the polyimide matrix with a uniform diameter of ca. 50A. The thermal stability and electrical properties of the films containing the CNTs were greatly improved due to the strong interfacial interaction and good dispersion between the polyimide matrix and modified CNTs. In addition, the thermal expansion coefficient of the composites films, as measured by thermo mechanical analysis, decreased with increasing CNT content, which is favorable for practical use in packaging and FPCB materials. 

Predictive transform for optimum digital signal processing 
A unified approach to optimum digital signal modeling, coding, estimation, and control is outlined. The origins of the proposed technique reside in a minimum-mean-square-error predictive transform (PT) coding formulation which yields a decoder that is a whitening PT model of the source whose output is to be encoded. This PT decoder is integrated with Kalman estimation (prediction, filtering and smoothing) as well as linear quadratic Gaussian control to produce a comprehensive approach to estimation and control that directly addresses the signal modeling problem. An additional bonus of the proposed unified approach to optimum digital signal processing is that a transformation mechanism arises which leads to significant design and implementation simplifications when the dimension of the signal is large. These ideas are illustrated with a 2D monochrome image application, where it is found that the design and implementation requirements of a PT smoother are often much less than those of a Kalman smoother with strictly similar performance. Specifically, the design computational burden is often improved by a factor greater than four and the implementation complexity burden by a factor close to four

The current state of nuclear power in the US is explored with particular emphasis on the effects of the nuclear accidents at the Three Mile Island (TMI) nuclear plant in 1979, and most recently at Chernobyl in 1986. The status of the US nuclear power industry is examined, and the current turmoil is discussed. The future of nuclear power in the US is assessed with respect to perceived national security needs and loss of public confidence 

Amodal Completion and Size Constancy in Natural Scenes 
We consider the problem of enriching current object detection systems with veridical object sizes and relative depth estimates from a single image. There are several technical challenges to this, such as occlusions, lack of calibration data and the scale ambiguity between object size and distance. These have not been addressed in full generality in previous work. Here we propose to tackle these issues by building upon advances in object recognition and using recently created large-scale datasets. We first introduce the task of amodal bounding box completion, which aims to infer the the full extent of the object instances in the image. We then propose a probabilistic framework for learning category-specific object size distributions from available annotations and leverage these in conjunction with amodal completions to infer veridical sizes of objects in novel images. Finally, we introduce a focal length prediction approach that exploits scene recognition to overcome inherent scale ambiguities and demonstrate qualitative results on challenging real-world scenes. 

The improved IMM tracking algorithm for high-speed maneuvering target 
This paper proposes an improved interacting multi-model (IMM) tracking algorithm based on the adaptive Markov transition probability matrix, which can be utilized in radar systems for high-speed maneuvering target tracking. The Markov transition probability matrix can be adaptive adjusted according to different characteristics of target motion state and the Markov transition probability matrix can be dynamically regulated between different models. The Monte Carlo simulation is carried out by software, which shows that the tracking performance of the algorithm is superior to the traditional method of IMM. 

Error Analysis Of An Underdetermined, Spectral Unfold Problem As Applied To An X-ray Absorption Spectrometer 
Random error propagation and unfold accuracy have been studied for the spectral unfold method used in the x-ray absorption spectrometer reported by Carlson [1]. This system of 13 measurements and 30 spectral bins (0.01 - 8 MeV) is underdetermined; a trial spectrum prevents unphysical solutions. Accuracy of the unfold was tested with simulated data from known spectra; the unfolds agreed with the known spectra to better than 10%, between 0.05 MeV and near the endpoints. Error propagation was studied by perturbing the input data randomly and unfolding the resulting data sets. In each unfold energy bin the standard deviation was taken as the propagated error. Above 0.05 MeV the unfold roughly doubled the input errors. The trial spectrum affects the unfold accuracy more strongly than the propagated errors. 

A direct plasma etch approach to high aspect ratio polymer micromachining with applications in bioMEMS and CMOS-MEMS 
A novel etching approach to high aspect ratio polymer micromachining is introduced. A switching chemistry utilizing oxygen as an etchant gas with a C/sub 4/F/sub 8/ passivation step has produced high aspect ratio polymer structures. Polymer layers have been bound to a mechanical silicon support, patterned and etched. The silicon is subsequently undercut creating suspended polymer membranes. The polymer microstructures have also been aligned with CMOS MEMS structures in a process compatible with post CMOS micromachining. All steps in the polymer micromachining and post CMOS release are compatible with standard MEMS processing equipment. This approach holds great promise for creating devices with CMOS electronics as sensors and actuators and aligned polymer microstructures serving as integrated fluidic conduits for bioMEMS and micro total analysis systems. 

Printed circuit board implementation of small inductors for domestic induction heating applications using a planar litz wire structure 
In this paper, the design and implementation of small inductors in printed circuit board (PCB) for domestic induction heating applications is presented. With this purpose, we have developed both a manufacturing technique and an electromagnetic model of the system based on finite-element method (FEM) simulations. The inductor arrangement consists of a stack of printed circuit boards in which a planar litz wire structure is implemented. The developed PCB litz wire structure minimizes the losses in a similar way to the conventional multi-stranded litz wires; whereas the stack of PCBs allows increasing the power transferred to the pot. Different prototypes of the proposed PCB inductor have been measured at low signal levels. Finally, a PCB inductor has been integrated in an electronic stage to test at high signal levels, i.e. in the similar working conditions to the commercial application. 

Decision problems of electric power systems: a call for research 
Load forecasting is the prediction of the amount of electricity that will be needed to supply a specific service area of customers. These forecasts have been considered an important aspect in operating and planning electric power systems. The load forecast may be viewed, however, as just one input to many decisions under uncertainty being made in a utility company. A description is given of the major decision junctions, treating load as one of the stochastic inputs. The objective is to formulate a series of problem statements that describe the needs of the utility community in the terminology of the decision scientists, thus promoting interest in solving these important large-scale decision-making problems

A novel reliable and compact inverter for wireless power transfer 
In this paper a highly reliable and compact inverter is proposed. This inverter is capable of both stepping up and stepping down the voltage and can be used for inductive wireless power transfer. The proposed inverter is an extension of the dc-dc C&#x0301;uk converter; therefore, a capacitor that forms the link is responsible for transferring the power from the input towards the output. The converter is designed and controlled such that the required link capacitance is very low; therefore, film capacitors can be used instead of electrolytic capacitors that are unreliable. The proposed inverter can offer soft-switching by adding a small inductor to the link. In this paper, the principles of the operation of the proposed inverter will be studied, and its performance will be evaluated. The application that is considered in this paper is wireless charging. 

Three approaches for the realization of a Chebyshev cross-coupled UWB filter 
This paper deals with the synthesis and realization of a UWB filter in the [3.168, 4.752] GHz band using a thin film IPD technology and a 4th order Chebyshev cross-coupled architecture that allows us to introduce two finite transmission zeroes out of band. In order to realize this filter, three approaches of realization were considered. The first approach was a classical use of the available technology, i.e. lumped elements. The second was the introduction of distributed capacitors to reduce the filter response sensitivity towards the industrial process variation. The last, dictated by size issues, consisted in using electromagnetic coupling in order to suppress a lumped inductor from the circuit. The three versions are described and results are discussed. 

Experimental analysis of LEDs'reliability under combined stress conditions 
There are many practical situations in which the reliability of a device cannot be correctly predicted by considering only a single stress. In these cases, the use of a more complicated life model working with multi-stress is needed: in practice, taking into account two stresses provides good results in several real applications. In this paper, the problem of deriving a life model for LEDs that can be usefully employed in actual operating conditions is faced. The combination of thermal stress and forward current is considered and a test system used to carry out an exhaustive measurement campaign is presented. The results of some experiments are also presented and discussed. 

Power-composition profile driven co-synthesis with power management selection for dynamic and leakage energy reduction 
Recent research has shown that the combination of dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) and adaptive body biasing (ABB) yields high energy reductions in embedded systems. Nevertheless, the implementation of DVS and ABB requires a significant system cost, making it less attractive for many small systems. In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to reduce this system cost and to achieve comparable energy saving to that obtained using combined DVS and ABB scheme through a co-synthesis methodology which is aware of the tasks' power-composition profile (the ratio of the dynamic power to the leakage power). In particular, the presented methodology performs a power management selection at the architectural level, i. e., it decides upon which processing elements to be equipped with which power management scheme (DVS, ABB, or combined DVS and ABB) - with the aim to achieve high energy savings at a reduced implementation cost. The proposed technique maps, schedules, and voltage scales applications specified as task graphs with timing constraints. Detailed experiments including a real-life benchmark are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. 

Multilevel coding for non-orthogonal broadcast 
This paper defines an information-theoretical framework for non-orthogonal broadcast systems with multilevel coding and gives design guidelines for the rate selection of multiple broadcast streams. This description includes hierarchical modulation and superposition coding with codes defined in a finite field as a special case. We show how multilevel coding can be applied to multiple antennas where, in contrast to most spacetime coding and hierarchical modulation schemes, no capacity loss occurs. 

Novel nonlinear filter for sins initial alignment with large misalignment angles 
In order to improve the precision and convergence rate of SINS initial alignment with large misalignment angles, a novel nonlinear filtering method, referred as square root simplex unscented quadrature Kalman filter (SR-SUQKF) is introduced into the initial alignment in this paper. By using the method of simplex unscented transformation to select a few cubature points and combining with Gauss-Laguerre quadrature rule to improve the numerical accuracy, a new set of high order sampling points with determined number and weighting coefficient are constructed and used for filtering with a square-root extension to improve the numerical stability. By means of mathematical simulation and turntable experiment, the filter performance of square root cubature Kalman filter (SR-CKF) and SR-SUQKF using three points in one dimension in SINS/GPS initial alignment on a moving base with large misalignment angles is analyzed and compared. The results of both experiments show that under the condition of large misalignment angles, the three-point SR-SUQKF can perform the initial alignment with high accuracy and high speed, the alignment accuracy and convergence rate of the three-point SR-SUQKF are much better than that of SR-CKF. The SR-SUQKF can be effectively used for the initial alignment with large misalignment angles in SINS/GPS and would be able to overcome inherent disadvantages associated with the conventional nonlinear filters. 

The system for identification of telephone wire lines 
Fixed telephone networks are based on copper wires. A lot of the twisted-pairs wires are the main transmission medium used in local telephone access networks to connect telephones or computers and other communication devices to the local exchange offices. The tangled wires run inside and outside of buildings, on telephone poles and in underground pipes but after all telecommunication operators must be able to identify the telephone subscriber number assigned to any desired pair of wires. The system presented below is solution of the problem by using GSM technology. The developed system is very simple but it assures very fast identification of the subscriber numbers at relatively low costs 

Extraordinary-transmission-inspired Bull's eye antenna for automotive radar 
Summary form only given. Leaky wave antennas have been studied since 1940s (C.H. Walter, Traveling Wave Antennas, Peninsula Pub., 1990). They have become a promising type of antenna for applications requiring low-profile antennas such as automotive radars (M. Ettorre, R. Sauleau, L. Le Coq, and F. Bodereau, IEEE Antennas Wirel. Propag. Lett. 9, 859, 2010). Unfortunately, pure broadside radiation cannot be achieved due to the open stopband effect.In this communication we will look at a leaky wave antenna that mimics broadside radiation by combing the radiation of two counter-propagating leakywaves (D. R. Jackson, A. A. Oliner, T. Zhao, and J. T. Williams, Radio Sci., 40, 1, 2005). Although neither of the leaky-waves radiates broadside, the angle of radiation is close enough to normal that the radiation pattern appears as a single beam. The antenna is based on a central resonant slot surrounded by corrugations in the form of Bull's Eye (M. Beruete, I. Campillo, J. S. Dolado, E. Perea, F. Falcone, and M. Sorolla, IEEE Antennas Wirel. Propag. Lett., 4, 365, 2005), and is originally inspired by the extraordinary optical transmission (F.J. Garcia-Vidal, L. Martin-Moreno, T.W. Ebbesen, and L. Kuipers, Rev. Modern Phys. 82, 729, 2010). The proposed antenna is completely metallic, unlike other leaky wave antennas proposed for millimeter-waves applications. Hence, dielectric losses, that cannot be disregard at these high frequencies, are completely removed, allowing higher gains. We will analysis the effect that the profile of the corrugations has in the radiation characteristics. In particular, we will demonstrate that sinusoidal rather than square corrugations are preferable if high directivity is required. We will link this to the different properties of the leaky-waves supported. Measurements of an all-metallic prototype with 20 sinusoidal corrugations shows at 77 GHz an input reflection coefficient of -20 dB, a 28 dB gain and side lobe level of -21.4 dB, in agreement w- th the numerical modelling. 

High field effects in MOSFETS 
"High field effects", such as hot-carrier effects and dielectric breakdown, which most significantly affect VLSI reliability are discussed. This paper describes: 1) the hot-carrier injection mechanism and modeling; 2) degradation characteristics: low voltage and low temperature hot-carrier effects, the influence of new processes and materials, degradation modeling, and the TDDB vs. hot-carrier phenomena; 3) hot-carrier resistant device structures and dielectrics, and the additional device breakdown phenomena (drain sustaining and gate-assisted surface breakdown); 4) new power supply voltage and the influence of hot-carrier effects on circuit noise and VLSI design methodology. These effects in MOSFETs inherent to device down-scaling impose the most stringent constraints on submicron MOS VLSI design, even after the power supply voltage is reduced to &#8764; 3V. 

Three-dimensional high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of human kidney 
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a rapidly emerging imaging modality that can non-invasively provide cross-sectional, high-resolution images of tissue morphology in situ and in real-time. Previous studies have demonstrated that OCT is capable of accurately visualizing the pathological changes in the living kidney in vivo using the Munich-Wistar rat model. In this work, we establish, for the first time, the capability of OCT to image the intact human kidney ex vivo. Characteristic kidney anatomic structures including the blood vessels, uriniferous tubules, glomeruli, and kidney capsules can be readily discerned. The diameter and volume parameters of these structures can also be automatically quantified. These two parameters may be critical in clinical applications such as the assessment of the donor kidney's viability prior to transplantation, or image the kidney responses to ischemic insult. 

Effects of external magnetic fields on the photoelectron emission from a copper beam chamber 
Applying magnetic fields around a beam chamber seems to be one of the effective methods to suppress the generation of electron cloud due to photoelectrons and, therefore, the beam size blow up of the positron beam observed at the KEKB. In order to investigate the effective magnetic field configuration and to estimate the necessary strength of it, the photoelectron current at the center of a test chamber is measured applying external magnetic fields. The test chamber is made of copper as the real beam chamber. The external magnetic fields are applied by a solenoid or small pieces of permanent magnets changing the magnetic field configuration, the structure of irradiated surface and the bias voltage of electrodes. The uniform magnetic field larger than about 50 G is found to be useful to reduce the photoelectrons at the beam position 

Simulate the State Changing of a Descriptor System in (Almost) Zero Time Using the Normal Probability Distribution 
In number of control applications, the ability of manipulate the state vector from the input is more than vital. Thus, in the present paper, we develop analytically a methodology for the state changing of a linear control descriptor differential system based also on a linear combination of Dirac &#x03B4;-function and its derivatives. Using linear algebra techniques and the generalized inverse theory, the input&#x02019;s coefficients are determined. In our practical numerical application, the Dirac distribution is approximated by the normal probability distribution. 

Mini-grid power system optimization design and economic analysis of solar powered sea water desalination plant for rural communities and emergency relief conditions 
This project develops a mini-grid hybrid power system to provide reliable supply of clean water supply for rural areas and emergency relief conditions. This design process includes the mini-grid power system with desalination plant and economic analysis for the whole project life cycle. The mini-grid power supply introduces solar power as the sole power supply after considering the geographical conditions of rural areas that make it not viable to build transmission line interconnection with the existing National Grid. Currently, these remote areas are highly depending on diesel generators which the transportation cost of fuel is often unaffordable. Furthermore, natural disasters such as tsunami, flood, earthquake, typhoon and volcanic eruption usually results in isolated areas which creates plenty of opportunities for renewable energy applications in emergency relief conditions where the massive destruction of infrastructures for power and clean water supply usually took place. The design scenario of mini-grid power system will be utilising solar and batteries as the energy storage system. This mini-grid power system will be supplying reliable power supply for desalination plant to provide clean water supply. The economic issues that will be considered are the initial capital cost invested, the total net present cost (NPC), the cost of electricity (COE) generated by the system per kWh and the simple payback time (SPBT) for the project. In addition, this project will support the renewable energy applications to reduce the green house gas (GHG) emission as following Malaysia's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by 40% by 2020. The simulation studies will be based on an actual set of conditions in a remote area in Pulau Tuba, Langkawi using HOMER. Experimental prototype of mini-grid inverter and desalination plant are developed to verify the reliability of power and water supply. 

Application of Mean-field Network In Track Correlation 
In a two-node distributed multisensor system, some algorithms of track correlation can be transformed to a generalized classical assignment problem, and the generalized classical assignment is a combined optimization problem. The model of mean-field network is proposed in this paper to solve the problem. The experimental results illustrate that using the neural network to solve the generalized classical assignment problem not only makes the track association correct percent high, but also cannot increase the computing time exponentially with the number of targets 

Robust optimization for empty container allocation problems under uncertainties 
Owing to trade imbalance, the challenge faced by liners is how to effectively manage their empty containers. In this paper, we develop a two-stage robust optimization model with a recourse function for solving the dynamic empty container allocation problems under net demand uncertainties. The level of conservatism is taken into account through a budget of uncertainty(&#x0393;), which is determined by the risk preference of decision-makers. We analyze the recourse function under the worst-case scenarios within the uncertainty budget set, transform the robust optimization model into a linear programming problem with a large number of constraints, and design an efficient solution method based on the properties of the model. Numerical experiments show that the price of robust in our model is low, and the CPU time is acceptable for industrial applications. 

Design and Analysis of Heat Regeneration Technique in Combined Cycle Power Plant 
In recent years, energy efficiency becomes one of the most frequently discussed topics in international forums and community, from which the notion of optimizing energy resources is introduced. Heat regeneration represents a mechanism to reuse the heat energy which is wasted during the energy conversion process, such practice is also known as combined cycle technique. This paper presents the analysis of a conversion from open cycle gas turbine power plant into a combined cycle power plant based on mathematical modeling and simulation. The scope is limited to the study of heat regeneration process in Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG), during which the running process converts feed water into steam before it is fed into a steam turbine to generate electricity. The main concerns to be examined involve the mechanical analysis of heat transfer media and PI controller design of heat exchanger. 

The linear quadratic Gaussian/loop transfer recovery technique for a class of distributed parameter systems 
This paper extends the Linear Quadratic Gaussian/Loop Transfer Recovery (LQG/LTR) technique to a class of distributed parameter systems that utilize bounded input and output operators, and that have spectra consisting only of isolated eigenvalues with finite multiplicity. The extension is not complete, but has been proven for two important subclasses of these systems. 

Reconstruction of non-constant velocity profiles in pneumatic pipelines by microwave inverse scattering techniques 
Inverse scattering techniques can be exploited to recover the solid distributions and the velocity profiles in different types of pipelines involving materials in motion. It is now known that these targets can be achieved by splitting the problem into two separate inverse procedures: the first working on the reconstruction of the dielectric permittivity only and the other one trying to recover the velocity field. 

P4-13: 50 keV Electrons energy loss distribution in multi-layer targets 
In shaped-beam lithography tools, a 50 keV electron beam is incident upon structures consisting of thin layers of resist and metal on the top of a massive silicon or quartz substrate. The desired result, resist exposure, is achieved by primary and secondary electrons losing energy in inelastic collisions with resist molecules. The exposure resolution depends on the electron energy loss distribution in the resist. We have modeled electron scattering in the mask with MONSEL software and developed an algorithm for extracting the energy loss distribution. Results obtained are in agreement with known resist exposure data. 

Realization of n-ZnO:Ga / p-ZnO:GaP homojunction by RF magnetron sputtering 
ZnO based LEDs are received great attention as it has wide band gap (~3.36 eV) and large exciton binding energy (~60 meV) at room temperature [1]. It is known that the basic components for LEDs are high quality p-type and n-type layers. The undoped ZnO exhibits intrinsic n-type conductivity and doping with III group elements such as B, In, Al, and Ga will enhance the electrical properties. But, it is too difficult to produce high quality p-type ZnO layers due to compensation of native defects, formation of deep acceptor and low solubility of dopants. 

Transformation of Control in Congruent Self-Reconfigurable Robot Topologies 
Much work on self-reconfigurable robotics has been focused on motion planning and physical reconfiguration of the robot. Using the Superbot self-reconfigurable robot, we focus on the details of realizing locomotion gaits given that a single robot topology can be realized in a large number of different ways. That is, each module in the robot topology has 4 symmetric orientations that are functional and shape equivalent. Once a role is selected for each module, such as through the use of hormone-inspired control, each module's role is supplied with a gait template which then must be transformed to suit the local configurations of each module with respect to the global topology. We provide a theoretical framework for which this can be accomplished 

Beam tests of the 10 keV injector for the University of Maryland electron ring (UMER) 
Results are presented of the first experiments with a 10 keV, 100 mA beam in the matching section for UMER. The section, about 1.5 m long, consists of one short solenoid, six printed-circuit (PC) quadrupoles, a bend PC dipole, a number of steering dipoles, and two sets of Helmholtz coils for balancing the Earth's field. The 2 RMS beam radius as a function of axial distance in the straight part of the beam line is obtained from fluorescent screen pictures. The results are compared with calculations using the K-V envelope equations. The importance of an accurate determination of the initial conditions, i.e. beam envelope size and slope at the entrance plane, as well as the emittance, is emphasized. Furthermore, the role of different types of errors, specially misalignment and quadrupole rotations is discussed 

A Ratio-Dependent Predator-Prey Model with Logistic Growth for the Predator Population 
Holling-Tanner model is revised with ratio-dependent functional response since ratio-dependent functional response is more appropriate when predator involves serious searching process. The essential mathematical features of the modified model have been analyzed with the help of local stability, global stability, bifurcation theory. Finally, analytical results have been interpreted in terms of ecology. 

Parametric Quintic Spline Solution for Second Order Singularly Perturbed Boundary Value Problem 
In this paper, a non polynomial quintic spline approach for solving the singularly perturbed boundary value problem is derived.

Quantitative assessment of the infarct transmurality using delayed contrast enhanced magnetic resonance images: description and validation 
The extent and degree of myocardial injury after an ischemic event are strong predictors of patient's outcome. After acute infarction, delayed contrast enhancement magnetic resonance imaging allows clinicians to distinguish between viable and non-viable myocardium and can delineate with high precision the infarcted tissue. The aim of this study is to provide a quantitative method based on the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm to assess the location and the extent of the infarcted area. Segmental infarct trasmurality was visually assessed on a 5-point scale for the 288 segments. The agreement between visual and quantitative analyses was good: 84% of the segments were categorized similarly by quantitative and visual analyses

The body driven low phase noise injection-locked V-band push-push complementary-Colpitts oscillator 
An injection-locked push-push oscillator is developed for millimeter-wave signal source. A V-band push-push CMOS voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is proposed in this study. A new core complementary Colpitts structure was adopted in a 90 nm CMOS process of FET induced capacitance of LC tank. The measured phase noise at 1 MHz offset is at 59 GHz. The power consumption of the VCO core is only 28.8 mW. The total chip size is 0.719 &#x00D7; 0.633 mm<sup>2</sup>. 

Phase modulated radio-over-fiber link with linearized electrooptic downconversion 
We demonstrate a technique for optically relaying and downconverting microwave signals. The system uses phase modulation in the transmitter and re-modulation and optical filtering in the receiver. Intermodulation distortion is suppressed by adjusting the amplitude of the local oscillator. 

Application of the 2D/3D MICHELLE code to electron gun and collector modeling 
The focus of the development program is to combine modern finite element techniques with improved physics models. The code employs a conformal mesh, including both structured and unstructured mesh architectures for meshing flexibility, along with a new method for accurate, efficient particle tracking. New particle emission models for thermionic beam representation are included that support primary emission, and secondary emission is handled with an advanced model. 

A review of international limits for harmonic voltages and currents in public networks 
Voltage and current distortion, in most countries, are presently limited by national standards which adopt or adapt the compatibility levels and emission limits of the IEC 61000 series of standards, or the proposed values of the IEEE 519 standard. This paper presents a review of international limits for public networks. Shortcomings of these standards are pointed out and some propositions for improvements are given. 

Uniform and nonuniform V-shaped isotropic planar arrays 
In this study, isotropic V-shaped uniform and nonuniform arrays are considered. An isotropic array has the same value for the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for all direction of arrival (DOA) angles. The conditions for isotropic V-shaped arrays are presented and closed form expressions for V-shaped uniform and nonuniform arrays are found. These expressions return the V-angle for the array. Therefore, given the number of sensors and sensor displacements, isotropic performance V-angle can be found easily. V-shaped arrays are compared with circular arrays and it is also shown that both uniform and nonuniform V-shaped arrays have certain advantages.

A RAKE structured SINR maximizing mobile receiver for the WCDMA downlink 
We propose a RAKE structured receiver with the pulse-shaping MF replaced with another FIR filter, and the sparse propagation channel MF by another sparse filter. We compare different choices for the design of the FIR filter and the sparse filter and their adaptation. We model the channel as an autoregressive first-order process over slot periods, with bandwidth commensurate with the Doppler spread, and we refine the brute pilot-based slot-wise estimate using adaptive causal Wiener filtering across slots. We then apply recursive path extraction in every slot. We also introduce polynomial expansion extensions, one at chip rate to improve the MMSE equalization performance of the structured chip rate equalizer, and one at symbol rate to bring the structured receiver performance closer to that of the global time-varying LMMSE receiver. 

The impact of power quality when high power pulsed DC and continuous AC loads are simultaneously operated on a MicroGrid testbed 
Technological advancements have been made in the field of electrochemistry leading to the development of energy storage devices that are more power dense than ever before. Coupled with their already modestly high energy density, this makes them well suited for use as the prime power source of many high pulsed and continuous power AC and DC loads operated within MicroGrid architectures. The energy storage devices of interest as well as the MicroGrid concept are both technologically immature. Their independent performance characteristics as well as the manner in which they can be integrated with one another need further research in order to understand their limitations and how they will perform in an extreme environment where high pulsed and continuous power loads are sourced simultaneously. With support from the US Office of Naval Research (ONR), a novel MicroGrid test-bed at UTA is being used to characterize how the power quality of different generation sources, including various low impedance energy storage technologies, solar panels, wind turbines, fuel cells, and fossil fuel based generators, are impacted when they are interconnected and used to source these types of high power loads. A description of the experimental setup and some experimental results obtained will be presented.

Измерение таких низких ставок газовыделения при комнатной температуре имеет много трудностей. Однако, инспекцией закона фика, видно, что тепловой десорбции пропорциональна скорости газовыделения. Общепризнано, что вредное ставка удваивается приблизительно каждые 15&deg;С при температурах ниже 100 ° С. Путем измерения скорости газовыделения в зависимости от температуры и времени и экстраполируя обратно до комнатной температуры можно измерить газовыделения ставки, которые в противном случае было бы трудно сделать. Чтобы произвести надежные измерения также требует общей площади поверхности исследуемого примерно на порядок больше, чем площадь измерительной камере стены. Для этого 27 плиты 5083 алюминиевой помещали в измерительную камеру. Этот метод будет основой для дальнейших исследований газовыделения показатели других образцов плит, изготовленных с различной механической обработки и методы очистки

Оптимальная конструкция precoder для системы MIMO с помощью решения приемников обратной связи 
Для precoder проектных задач в мульти-мульти ввода-вывода (MIMO) системы связи, безупречное знание информации о состоянии канала (CSI) на обоих передатчиком и приемником обычно необходима. Однако, часто трудно обеспечить достаточно оперативную и точную обратную связь КОБ от приемника к передатчику для таких конструкций должны быть практически осуществимо. В данной статье мы рассмотрим оптимальную конструкцию precoder на беспроводную связь имея М передатчик антенн и N приемных антенн (М &ЛТ; N), в которых каналы предполагаются плоскими потертостями и могут быть скоррелированы. Мы предполагаем, что полный CSI известен в приемнике, но только первого и второго порядка статистики каналов в передатчике. Наша цель-придумать эффективную конструкцию оптимальной precoder такой технологии MIMO системы, минимизируя среднее арифметическое-из среднеквадратичной ошибки (СКО) нулевого заставляя решением обратной связи (ЗФ-ДФ) обнаружение влечет ограничение на общую мощность сигнала. Мы преобразуем это невыпуклые задачи оптимизации в выпуклой задаче геометрического программирования, которая затем может быть эффективно решена с использованием метода внутренней точки. Для случая, когда каналы передачи являются некоррелированными, замкнутой формы решения для оптимального precoder была получена. Превосходное качество нашей системы MIMO оснащен оптимальный precoder подтверждена результатами компьютерного моделирования.
